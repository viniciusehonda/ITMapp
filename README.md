# ITMapp
A multi-plataform (Android &amp; iOS) app using Xamarin for general "incidents" registration on map

This is my university "final test". The idea is to develop a app where users can:
-Register Incidents (Everything that can bring problems to the environment or people)
Each Incident have
 -Category
 -Type
 -Description
 -User (Who registered the Incident)
 -Rating (Like or Dislike)
 -Day/Month/Year/Time
 
Incidents examples:
 Category / Type
 Violence / Robbery
 Violence / Steal
 Traffic / Traffic
 Traffic / Accident
 General / Festival
 General / Event
 
 -Delete your own registered Incidents
 -Check for Incidents
 -Evaluete Incidents registered by other users
